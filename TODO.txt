Higher Priority:
    - Remove stray voxels.
    - More sensible UI (e.g. start with an empty, or start with a cube and REPLACE it's geometry.)
        - Also, make the "clear" button also clear the geometry.
            - Try to get the memory usage down when this happens.
        - Turn the "generate mesh" button into "regenerate mesh", which clears and then remakes the mesh.
    - Look into packaging in a way that is user-friendly, and does not require administrator mode.
        - Get someone else to test out the plugin, to make sure it works.
    - Generate a test case for a concave object, and make sure that the updated approach works for it.
    - Image editing from within Blender.

=======================================

The following would be nice, but are lower priority:

    NURBS fitting / voronoi / etc. for generating the geometry.

    Deal with images at different scales from one another, etc.

    Machine learning and depth map generation?

    Deal with images that are at slight angles compared to environment and/or each other.

    How to "convert" perspective IRL images to orthographic? Even if it's just ignoring regions for now, or trying to scale them, etc.
    TBH that'd be tough and would probably take more than a semester to get perfect.

    Semi-automated/sketch tool for starting from "plain" images?
