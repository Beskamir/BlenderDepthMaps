Colour-coding the different faces' voxels for ease of debugging.\

Figure out why the ranges for certain concave images are wrong.
    Start by printing out the lowest-edge pixel and its location, as well as the "matching" pixel in the neighbour image and its location.

Fix the indexing error occurring in the spoon test case.

Image scaling.

Once the 3D-point-array-generating function works, try to optimize it a bit more.

=======================================

NURBS fitting and/or marching cubes.

Deal with images at different scales from one another, etc.

Stretch goals:
    Machine learning and depth map generation?

    Deal with images that are at slight angles compared to environment and/or each other.

    How to "convert" perspective IRL images to orthographic? Even if it's just ignoring regions for now, or trying to scale them, etc.
    TBH that'd be tough and would probably take more than a semester to get perfect.

    Semi-automated/sketch tool for starting from normal images?
